Malaysia does not allow landlords to evict tenants without proper legal procedure.

Core rules:
1. A landlord must first issue a written notice of breach, such as for unpaid rent or violation of the tenancy agreement.
2. The notice should specify the problem and give the tenant reasonable time to correct it, typically 14–30 days.
3. If the tenant does not comply, the landlord may terminate the tenancy agreement by issuing a termination notice.
4. Forceful eviction such as changing locks, removing tenant belongings, or cutting utilities is illegal.
5. If the tenant refuses to leave, the landlord must file a civil suit in court to obtain a court order for vacant possession.
6. Only the court can authorize eviction. Bailiffs may be appointed to enforce the order if necessary.
7. Landlords may claim unpaid rent, damages, or compensation during the court process.

These are general eviction procedures under Malaysian tenancy law.
