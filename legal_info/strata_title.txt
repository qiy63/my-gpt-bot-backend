The Strata Titles Act 1985 governs properties such as apartments, condominiums, and stratified commercial buildings in Malaysia.

Important rules:
1. A strata title is issued for individual units in a multi-storey or subdivided building.
2. Owners share ownership of common property such as lifts, corridors, parking areas, and facilities.
3. A management body (MC or JMB) manages the building and common areas.
4. Owners must pay monthly maintenance fees and sinking fund contributions for upkeep of the property.
5. The JMB or MC can enforce house rules to maintain order and safety.
6. Owners have voting rights in meetings based on share units.
7. Any renovation that affects the building structure requires approval from the management and local authority.
8. Disputes are usually resolved through the Strata Management Tribunal.

These rules apply to most condominiums, apartments, and stratified developments.
