Types of Deposits in Malaysia

In Malaysia, tenancy agreements commonly require the tenant to pay:

Security Deposit

Usually equivalent to 2 months’ rent

Held by landlord as protection against:

Property damage

Unpaid rent

Breach of tenancy terms

Utility Deposit

Typically ½ month’s rent

Covers unpaid electricity, water, internet, or service charges

Advance Rent

Usually 1 month’s rent

Applied as rent for the first month of tenancy

There is no single statute fixing deposit amounts; these are governed by contract law and industry practice.

2️.Legal Nature of Deposits

Deposits are not the landlord’s income

They must be:

Held in trust

Used only for legitimate deductions

Unreasonable or arbitrary deductions may be legally challenged

3️.Use of Security Deposit

A landlord may deduct from the security deposit for:

Unpaid rent

Repair of tenant-caused damage (excluding fair wear and tear)

Cleaning costs if property is returned in poor condition

Outstanding utility bills

The landlord cannot deduct for:

Normal wear and tear

Pre-existing defects

Improvements not requested or agreed by tenant

4️.Refund of Deposit

Best practice in Malaysia:

Deposit should be refunded within 14–30 days after:

Tenant vacates the property

Final inspection is completed

Utilities are settled

If deductions are made:

Landlord should provide:

Written explanation

Receipts or cost breakdown (recommended)

5️.Disputes Over Deposits

If a dispute arises:

Parties should attempt amicable settlement

Tenant may issue a Letter of Demand

Claims may be filed at:

Small Claims Court (for lower-value disputes)

Civil Courts (contract breach)

Unstamped tenancy agreements may still be enforceable for deposit recovery, but stamping is strongly recommended.

6️.Recommended Clause (Example)

Security Deposit Clause:
The Tenant shall pay a security deposit equivalent to two (2) months’ rent, which shall be refundable within thirty (30) days after termination of the tenancy, subject to deductions for unpaid rent, damage beyond fair wear and tear, or breach of this Agreement.
