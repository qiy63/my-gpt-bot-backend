The National Land Code (NLC) 1965 is the main legislation governing land matters in Peninsular Malaysia.

Important principles:
1. All land is under the authority of the State Authority of each state.
2. Land ownership is proven through the land title, which is registered in the land office.
3. The Torrens System applies: the person named on the title is the legal owner.
4. Types of land titles include freehold, leasehold, and temporary occupation licenses.
5. Land dealings such as transfer, lease, charge, or subdivision must be registered with the land office to be legally effective.
6. Restrictions in interest may apply, meaning the owner may need consent from the state before selling or leasing the property.
7. Land use is controlled by categories such as residential, commercial, industrial, or agricultural.
8. The State Authority can acquire private land for public purposes under the Land Acquisition Act, with payment of compensation.

These are the core concepts of the National Land Code relevant to real estate.
