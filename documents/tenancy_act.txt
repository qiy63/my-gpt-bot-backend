In Malaysia, residential tenancies are governed mainly by the tenancy agreement between the landlord and the tenant. There is no single official Tenancy Act, but common practices are widely used.

Key rules:
1. A tenancy agreement typically covers duration, rental amount, deposit, duties of tenant and landlord, and termination conditions.
2. Deposits usually include two months’ rental deposit and one month utility deposit.
3. Landlords must give reasonable notice (usually 30–60 days) before terminating a tenancy unless there is a breach of contract.
4. Rent cannot be increased during the tenancy period unless the agreement specifically allows it.
5. Repairs for structural issues are generally the landlord’s responsibility, while minor repairs are usually the tenant’s responsibility.
6. If a tenant fails to pay rent, the landlord must give written notice before taking action.
7. Eviction can only happen through proper legal process. A landlord cannot forcibly remove a tenant or change locks without notice.
8. Any disputes are usually settled under civil contract law in Malaysian courts.

These rules apply generally to private residential tenancies in Malaysia.
